# Simple Payment Form

Created a simple payment form completely on my own. At this point in my career, I am seeing that as long as I have a design to work with, using HTML and CSS becomes easier to realise that design. Although, I run into minor issues. For instance, in this mini-project, I haven't yet figured out how to go about adding a border around the title and the radio inputs. The border should go through the title "Title" and around the inputs. I managed to accomplish that in sorts, but it goes around the entire fieldset of contact information, which is not what I want.
